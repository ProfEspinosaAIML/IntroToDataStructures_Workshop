    "### Recap: Maintaining the Instructor vs Student Branch Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "During our development session, we went through the full lifecycle of setting up and maintaining\n",
    "a branching workflow for this project. Here’s a summary of the key steps we completed together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial Setup**: We created the `main` branch for students and the `instructor` branch for teaching staff.\n",
    "  The `main` branch only contains challenge/solution notebooks that students should see, while\n",
    "  the `instructor` branch contains additional materials such as the full source notebook,\n",
    "  utility scripts, configuration files, and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Switching Between Branches**: We practiced moving between `main` and `instructor` branches using commands like:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  git checkout main\n",
    "  git checkout instructor\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This workflow ensures that edits to the source notebook and utilities are isolated in the instructor branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Protecting Student Branch**: We updated `.gitignore` so that sensitive or instructor-only files\n",
    "  (such as `utils/`, `documentation/`, `config.json`, and `IntroToDataStructures_Workshop.ipynb`) are never committed to `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accidental File Deletion and Recovery**: At one point, instructor-only files were mistakenly removed from the branch.\n",
    "  We restored them by checking out the files from the `instructor` branch using commands like:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  git checkout instructor -- utils/ documentation/ config.json SETUP.md IntroToDataStructures_Workshop.ipynb\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  This highlighted the importance of keeping backups in the `instructor` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Updating Workshop Files**: When changes were made to the source notebook (`IntroToDataStructures_Workshop.ipynb`),\n",
    "  we used the `toggle_solutions.py` utility to generate the correct student-facing versions:\n",
    "  - `IntroToDataStructures_Workshop_challenge.ipynb` before/during the workshop\n",
    "  - `IntroToDataStructures_Workshop_solutions.ipynb` after the workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronizing Branches**: We ensured that updates from the source notebook in `instructor`\n",
    "  flowed correctly into the challenge/solution notebooks in `main`, without exposing instructor-only files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these steps form a robust workflow where students always receive clean materials from the `main` branch,\n",
    "while instructors retain full control of the source and teaching utilities in the `instructor` branch.\n"
